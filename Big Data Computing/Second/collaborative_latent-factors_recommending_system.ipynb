    " # Collaborative Latent-Factors-Based Filtering for Movie Recommendations (Incomplete)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The latent factor approach in recommendation systems utilizes matrix factorization techniques to uncover hidden patterns in user-item interactions. These methods predict user preferences by mapping both users and items to a shared latent space where their interactions can be represented by their proximity or alignment. Latent factor models, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), are widely used in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the latent factor approach:\n",
    "- Captures underlying relationships between users and items.\n",
    "- Handles sparse datasets effectively by reducing dimensionality.\n",
    "- Improves scalability compared to neighborhood-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the latent factor approach to build a movie recommendation system using matrix factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The latent factor approach works by:\n",
    "- Represent users and items in a shared lower dimensional latent space (i.e., as a vector of latent factors).\n",
    "- Such vectros are inferred (i.e., learned) from the observed ratings.\n",
    "- High correlation between user and item latent factors indicates a possible recomendation.\n",
    "- Map both users and items to the latent space and then predict ratings based on the inner product in the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally we have:\n",
    "- $R = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 5\\} \\lor R = [0, 1]$ is the set of ratings.\n",
    "- $\\vec x_u \\in R^d$ is the latent factor vector for user $u$. Each $\\vec x_u[k] \\in R$ measure the extent of interest user $u$ has in items exhibiting latent factor $k$.\n",
    "- $\\vec w_i \\in R^d$ is the latent factor vector for item $i$. Each $\\vec w_i[k] \\in R$ measure the extent of interest item $i$ has in users exhibiting latent factor $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, $d$ hidden features to describe both users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $r_{u,i}$ is the rating given by user $u$ to item $i$ and $\\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\vec x_u \\cdot \\vec w_i = \\sum_{k=1}^d \\vec x_u[k] \\cdot \\vec w_i[k]$ is the predicted rating for user $u$ and item $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to approximate the user-item matrix $M \\in \\mathbb R^{n \\times m}$ with the product of a user latent factor matrix $X \\in \\mathbb R^{n \\times d}$ and an item latent factor matrix $W^T \\in \\mathbb R^{d \\times m}$. So\n",

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two datasets for this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Movies Dataset**:\n",
    "   - `Movie_ID`: Unique identifier for each movie.\n",
    "   - `Title`: Name of the movie.\n",
    "   - `Year`: Year the movie was released.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ratings Dataset**:\n",
    "   - `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each user.\n",
    "   - `Movie_ID`: Identifier for the movie rated by the user.\n",
    "   - `Rating`: Numeric rating provided by the user (e.g., on a scale of 1-5)."
